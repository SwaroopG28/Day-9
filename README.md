# Topic Modeling with LDA

This project demonstrates topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Topic modeling is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover hidden topics in a collection of documents.

## **Project Overview**

- **Dataset**: 20 Newsgroups dataset, containing discussion posts on various topics like sports, technology, and politics.
- **Goal**: Identify and visualize latent topics in the text data.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal.
  - Topic Modeling: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
  - Visualization: Word clouds and pyLDAvis.

## **How It Works**

### 1. **Preprocessing**
We clean the text data to make it suitable for modeling:
- Convert text to lowercase.
- Remove stopwords and punctuation.
- Lemmatize words to their base forms.

### 2. **Bag of Words**
We transform the preprocessed text into a numerical representation using the Bag of Words (BoW) model, where each document is represented by word frequencies.

### 3. **LDA Modeling**
Using the LDA algorithm:
- Extract `10` topics from the dataset.
- Each topic is represented by a set of important words.

### 4. **Visualization**
- **pyLDAvis**: An interactive visualization to explore topics and their relationships.
- **Word Clouds**: Visual representation of the most important words in each topic.
